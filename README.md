# Pillars V.S. Killers
![Screenshot 2025-05-28 123308](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ca552df-df46-485d-9042-ce97d4ad24b3)


## Overview
In short, Pillars against Killers.
A 2D minimalistic styled Tower Defence game of **Pillars attacking Killers**. The game will require players to beat waves of killers, that travel along a path. To survive, players build `pillars` (towers) that attack `killers` to prevent them from reaching the end.


## Planned Features
- 40 Killers of varying strength. More info in **Planned Enemies (Killers)**
- 10 different pillars to build, each with their purpose (ie. slow down, melt armour, AoE splash). More info in **Planned Pillars (Towers)**
- 100 Waves to fight. On Normal+, winning the game will require you to beat Wave 100: **TON 618**. This killer is slow, but will have insane amounts of HP, and insane armour.
- Every 20th wave is a checkpoint. Checkpoints automatically save a player's progress once wave 20, 40 is beaten and can reload their progress. note: killer's thrill saves funtion differently. 1Pill2Nil has no saving (except once for endless)
- Researching new pillars/towers - Players will need to pay a research fee to unlock stronger pillars
- Different maps to choose from in various difficulties
- Endless mode (enemies getting exponentially tougher until you die)
- Settings and vfx disabling
- 4 difficulty levels: Chill (Easy), Normal (medium), Killer's Thrill (Hard), 1Pill2Nil (EXTREME)
- French translation (THIS IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE)

These are not final, they can change as development progresses. 

## The Pillars
Your defense. You depend on these pillars to prevent getting killed by the killers. Each pillar has its own purpose, and you may need to use different pillars to succeed. More advanced pillars may require research.

## The Killers

Killers come in various shapes and strengths. A good number of them has different properties such as healing, slow immune, or even attacking (not confirmed if that will be implemented). This list is NOT complete, 40 are planned + final boss
