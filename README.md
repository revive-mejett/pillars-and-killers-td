# Pillars V.S. Killers
![pvk_banner_repo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63742d48-98fc-468e-bdb4-9876251393f6)

## Overview
In short, Pillars against Killers.
A 2D minimalistic styled Tower Defence game of **Pillars attacking Killers**. The game will require players to beat waves of killers, that travel along a path. To survive, players build `pillars` (towers) that attack `killers` to prevent them from reaching the end.


## Planned Features
- 40 Killers of varying strength (including 5 bosses) + 1 final boss (41 total different killers). More info in **Planned Enemies (Killers)**
- 11-12 different pillars to build, each with their purpose (ie. slow down, melt armour, AoE splash). More info in **Planned Pillars (Towers)**
- 100 Waves to fight. Winning the game will require you to beat Wave 100, which is the final boss: **TON 618**. This boss is slow, but will have insane amounts of HP, insane armour, slow immunity, and EMP attacks.
- Researching new pillars/towers - Players will need to pay a research fee and wait to unlock stronger pillars
- Different maps to choose from in various difficulties
- Endless mode (enemies getting exponentially tougher until you die)
- Settings and vfx disabling
- French translation (THIS IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE)

These are not final, they can change as development progresses. 

## The Pillars
TBD***
Your defense. You depend on these pillars to prevent getting killed by the killers. Each pillar has its own purpose, and you may need to use different pillars to succeed.

## The Killers

Killers come in various shapes and strengths. A good number of them has different properties such as healing, slow immune, or even attacking (not confirmed if that will be implemented). This list is NOT complete, 40 are planned + final boss
